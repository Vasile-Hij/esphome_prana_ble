# ESPHome component for Prana recuperators.

This is unofficial component to connect your Prana recuperator with Home Assistant via Bluetooth.

This project is still work in progress, if you have any problems with it, feel free to open an issue.

What is working for now:
  - Controlling fans speed. For now only both directions control available.
  - Voltage and frequency sensors. Available only for old recuperators with 220V fans.
  - Turn on/off, winter mode, heater switches.



See [example config](https://github.com/voed/esphome_prana_ble/blob/master/prana_conf_example.yaml) to create your own configuration.
